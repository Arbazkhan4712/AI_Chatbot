## Install Packages
Before starting to work on our chatbot we need to download a few python packages. Please note as of writing this these packages will ONLY WORK IN PYTHON 3.6. Hopefully this will be fixed in the future.

We will simply use pip to install the following:
- numpy
- nltk
- tensorflow
- tflearn

Simply go to CMD and type: pip install "package name". Where you will replace "package_name" with all of the entries listed above.
